# ChatAndVoIP
This application is a simple Chat and VoIP client exclusively implemented in Java. It uses the Swing framework for the GUI implementation and threads for concurrent speech transmission and receiving.

## Future Work

 - Use JavaFX or Vaadin Designer instead of Swing for GUI implementation.
 - Add echo cancelation.
 - Check why the Greek language is not supported.
 - Add encryption to the messages.
 - Get the configuration through an XML file.
